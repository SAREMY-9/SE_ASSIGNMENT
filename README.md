Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the design, develop and maintain of software using engineering designs and principles.
Enables the creation of reliable, scalable and efficient software solutions for diverse needs.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of high-level programming languages,1950s-1950, early programming was done using machine code, but languages like COBOL and FORTRAN marked a shift in the way code was writte.
The The introduction of structured programming languages, this concept helped to reduce code complexity and enhanced readability of code leading to enhanced software solutions.
The Rise of Agile and DevOps (2000s-Present): The Agile Manifesto emphasized flexibility and customer collaboration over rigid processes, leading to faster and more responsive software development.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Gathering and Analysis: Collecting and analyzing user needs to define the software’s goals and functionalities.
Design: Creating a blueprint of the software architecture and selecting technologies.
Implementation/Coding: Writing the actual code based on design specifications.
Testing: Evaluating the software to ensure it meets requirements and is free of defects.
Deployment: Releasing the final product to users.
Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, fixing issues, and updating the software as needed.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a sequential or linear way of development where each step has to be done one after the other it's suitable for projects with fixed requirements whereas agile methodology is iterative with changing requirements, as the project moves along.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Writes, tests, and debugs code to meet project requirements. They are responsible for implementing functionalities and ensuring the code meets specifications.
Quality Assurance Engineer: Develops test cases, conducts various tests (e.g., unit, integration), and identifies defects. Their goal is to ensure the software meets quality standards.
Project Manager: Coordinates team efforts, manages timelines, and ensures the project stays on schedule and within budget. They serve as a communication link between clients and the development team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs provide tools like code editors, debuggers, and compilers in one environment, increasing developer productivity (e.g., Visual Studio, IntelliJ IDEA).
Version Control Systems, such as Git, track code changes, allow collaboration, and manage versions, ensuring a history of changes and supporting rollbacks.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Scope Creep: Avoided by defining clear requirements and setting boundaries early.
Tight Deadlines: Managed through realistic timelines and prioritizing tasks.
Complex Codebases: Overcome by maintaining documentation and following code standards.
Rapidly Changing Technologies: Addressed by continuous learning and staying updated with trends.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing involves testing different features/individual components as a unit to ensure they're working correctly.
Integration testing verifies that different modules work together as expected.
System testing tests the entire system to ensure ensure it's working correctly as expected.
Acceptance testing ensures that the system meets user expectations and requirements.

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting specific inputs (prompts) to guide AI models toward desired outputs.
This process is essential for maximizing an AI model’s effectiveness, as well-defined prompts lead to more accurate and relevant responses, making interactions with AI models more efficient and valuable.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example "Tell me about an engine"
Improved prompt, "Describe the mechanics behind the working of a Boeing  aeroplane engine."
